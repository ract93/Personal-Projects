Senior thesis on camera transform in computer vision.

Created a detailed program spec and prototype implementation of a camera transform: a system that is able to convert GPS coordinates to 2 Dimensional coordinates on an autonomous vehicle's camera view and back. 

Implemented using linear algebra, OpenCV, and C++. Algorithm implemented using haversine transform, calibrated camera matrix, and steroscopic projection
